"Quality is the totality of characteristics and values of a software product that relate to its ability to meet stated or implied requirements." [_Software Quality according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126[ISO/IEC 9126; ISO 25010]]_

The most important quality goals have already been described in â†’ https://oe160.iml.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/IOT/Chapter+1%3A+Introduction+and+Goals#Chapter1:IntroductionandGoals-1.3QualityGoals[Section 1.3].
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios.
We also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.
The quality scenarios depict the fundamental quality goals as well as other required quality properties.
They allow the evaluation of decision alternatives.
