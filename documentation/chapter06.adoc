= Chapter 6: Runtime View

*Contents*

* <<6.1 TBD>>

In contrast to the static building block view, this section visualizes dynamic aspects of the {projectName}.

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks across the architecture, i.e., how instances of building blocks of the {projectName} perform their job and communicate at runtime.

Important usage scenarios with architectural relevance are e.g. interactions at critical external interfaces, operation and administration (launch, start-up, stop), and error and exception scenarios.
