### üîé Prerequisites

---

You have to install the following tools before the installation steps listed below can be performed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js 16.16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
    - [Truffle plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18559-truffle)
    - [Solidity plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9475-solidity)
    - [Prettier plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier)

#### [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache)

This software combines the CLI and GUI components of Ganache in one package. It makes the development process more
comfortable, instead of using only the CLI.

#### [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea)

We recommend IntelliJ IDEA as your local IDE.

At first change the following properties in the settings section:

- **Settings** -> **Editor** -> **Inspections** -> **JavaScript and TypeScript** -> **General**
    - Disable: **Unneeded last comma in array literal**
    - Disable: **Unneeded last comma in object literal**
- **Settings** -> **Languages & Frameworks** > **JavaScript** > **Prettier**
    - Enable: **On 'Reformat Code' action**

Afterwards install and configure the plugin **SonarLint** according to these
[instructions](https://oe160.iml.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/HOW/IntelliJ).

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

---

The following installation steps must be performed to develop and interact with the smart contract on your local
machine:

1. Clone the repository
    - `git clone git@gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de:silicon-economy/base/blockchainbroker/ethereum/projects/solidity-libraries/nft-folder.git`
2. Install dependencies
    - `npm install`
3. Start Ganache
    - Click on **NEW WORKSPACE** and then **ADD PROJECT**
        - Select the file `truffle-config.js` from the root folder of the cloned repository
    - Click on **SAVE WORKSPACE**
    - Click on **CONTRACTS** in the upper navigation bar
        - The smart contract has yet to be deployed, as evidenced by the message indicating that it is **Not Deployed**.
4. Execute tests
    - `npm run test`
    - Every single test should be executed successfully
    - Before and after this script is executed the scripts `pretest` and `posttest` are executed respectively
        - While the former starts the CLI component of Ganache in the background, the latter terminates the
          corresponding process
5. Deploy the smart contract to your local Ganache instance
    - `npm run local:deploy`
    - For every smart contract, which needs to be deployed, the folder `migrations` contains a migration file
    - In the **CONTRACTS** overview of Ganache the smart contracts `Migrations` and `Counter` have an
      address which means that they are now deployed

<div style="text-align: right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</div>

### üïπÔ∏è Usage

---

Once the installation process has been successfully completed, you will be able to interact with the smart contract.

In this example the first account from the **ACCOUNTS** overview of Ganache executes the `increment` function.
These commands can only be executed with a running Ganache instance.

- `npm run console:local`
- `const instance = await Counter.deployed();`
- `instance.increment();`

### ‚öóÔ∏èDevelopment

---

This is just a little quickstart. For a thorough introduction into our development process, please refer to
the [Developer Guidelines](https://oe160.iml.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/HOW/Developer+Guidelines).

Push never ever to `main` directly! Always create a new branch with a comprehensive name, which consists of three parts
(e.g. `feature/se1234-implement-staking-mechanism`)

- type (`feature`, `improvement`, `bugfix`, `refactoring`, `documentation`, ...)
- ticket number (`seDDDD`)
- what you want to achieve

Every commit message must contain a subject line, written in the imperative mood (e.g. `Fix transfer function`). When
you merge the branch into `main`, you need to squash all your commits into a single commit. This is where you should
provide a detailed text so that others (and the future you) understand why you made these changes. Please take a look
into some good examples and best practices regarding commit messages:
[#1](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)
[#2](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages)
[#3](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-commit-messages-best-practices)

When you commit, the commands `npm run prettier:check` and `npm run solhint` are executed automatically on your changed
files. If they find any issues, the commit will not be created. To successfully create the commit, you must fix these
issues beforehand.

Additionally, everytime the file `package.json` is updated, the command `npm run license-checker` is executed which
collects all licenses from all npm modules within the folder `node_modules`. These licenses are then written into three
different files and automatically added to the git staging area:

- `third-party-licenses.csv` contains license information for all npm modules
- `third-party-licenses-complementary.csv` contains license information for every npm module with an unknown license
- `third-party-licenses-summary.txt` contains all licenses with their occurrences

After you have made all the necessary changes, someone will need to review and approve your branch. It might be a good
idea to discuss your implementation with the reviewer beforehand, so he can ask questions to get a better understanding
of the changes and your thoughts. Afterwards he looks at the changes by himself and makes some comments and suggestions
in GitLab. You must provide a response to any comments he writes and implement those suggestions as appropriate. If
something is unclear, talk to the reviewer again. At the end, you need to make sure that all comments are resolved. If
the reviewer approved your merge request, you may merge your branch into `main`.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏èDeployment

---

In order to deploy the smart contract to testnet, you have to follow these steps:

1. Make sure the project root folder contains an `.env` file with the following entries:

   |        **Key**         |     **Required for**     | 
               | :--------------------: | :----------------------: |
   |  TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY   |  Deployment to testnet   |
   |     INFURA_API_KEY     |  Deployment to testnet   |
   |   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY    |   Verifying on testnet   |

2. Start your local Ganache instance

    - Execute the actual script `npm run ganache:start`

3. Deploy the smart contract to your local Ganache instance

    - Execute the actual script `npm run deploy:local`

4. After you have tested the smart contract in Ganache successfully, you may deploy it to the testnet

    - Execute the script `npm run deploy:testnet`
    - Now the `Migrations` contract will recognize that the migration script has not been executed for the testnet yet
    - In order to see the contract code on Etherscan, you need to execute the script `npm run testnet:verify"`
        - It will verify and publish the new contract source code to Etherscan
